# Service Approval Accelerator for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Identity & Access Management

### Authentication

Kubernetes itself does not manage users and authentication--this is intended to be done by the service provider [1].
This can be done by AKS, but it is recommended to use the integration with Azure Active Directory [2].
Using AD lets you manage users in a central place that can be used across many different Azure services.

2.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/aks/security-baseline#31-maintain-an-inventory-of-administrative-accounts

### Authorization

It is considered best practice to manage user authorization with role-based access control (RBAC); see below.

"Managed identities" can be used for authorization between pods and other Azure services, such as Storage and databases.
Pod identities are defined and assigned permissions.
Specified pods then authenticate as an identity, receiving an access token which can be used by the application to authorize with permitted services.
Hence, your application code doesn't need to include credentials to access a service; each pod authenticates with its own identity, so you can audit and review access.

### RBAC

RBAC is split into two domains.

The first is at the Azure service level.
User accounts in Active Directory can be assigned roles which restrict access to a certain set of services or resources in the subscription.
User access to AKS can be controlled to a fine level of detail, but there are some built-in roles [2]:

| Role       | Description     | Link     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Viewer | Allows read-only access to see most objects in a namespace. It doesn't allow viewing roles or role bindings. This role doesn't allow viewing Secrets, since reading the contents of Secrets enables access to ServiceAccount credentials in the namespace, which would allow API access as any ServiceAccount in the namespace (a form of privilege escalation)   | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#built-in-roles    |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer   | Allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace. This role doesn't allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings. However, this role allows accessing Secrets and running Pods as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so it can be used to gain the API access levels of any ServiceAccount in the namespace. | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#built-in-roles |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin   | Allows admin access, intended to be granted within a namespace. Allows read/write access to most resources in a namespace (or cluster scope), including the ability to create roles and role bindings within the namespace. This role doesn't allow write access to resource quota or to the namespace itself. | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#built-in-roles |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Cluster Admin   |Allows super-user access to perform any action on any resource. It gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#built-in-roles |
||||


Secondly, there is the Kubernetes RBAC system.
This permits fine-grained control of the Kubernetes resources themselves via Role and ClusterRole definitions.
These are then linked with users via integration with Active Directory by RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings.

There is a feature in Preview which integrates the Kubernetes RBAC authorization with Azure RBAC [1].
This means you can define Kubernetes roles in the same system you define roles for Azure resources, and AKS will use Azure to authorize Kubernetes access requests.

3.  https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/

### Privileged Access Management

As discussed, identities should be managed via Azure Active Directory.
Azure provides guidance and AD functionality for managing privileged identities, such as the Privileged Access Management notification service.

## Encryption & Secure Data Management

### Encryption of Data at Rest

AKS allows connecting pods to persistent storage via volumes.
Volumes are backed by the Azure Storage product, which encrypts all data as standard[4].
The encryption, decryption, and key management processes are transparent to users.
Customers can also choose to manage their own keys using Azure Key Vault.
There are a variety of methods for authenticating with the Storage platform.

Note that this also applies to fully managed components, such as etcd[3].

3.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-security#kubernetes-secrets
4.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption

### Encryption of Data in Transit

In-transit encryption is generally more an application layer concern and not considered by the lower-layer routing and network services that Kubernetes offers.
However, it does support "ingress controllers" which can process data at the application level, including decryption of TLS for routing to pods.
This allows centralised management of TLS at the Kubernetes networking level, even for pod applications which do not support it.

1.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/aks/concepts-network

### Certificate & Key Management

Ingress controllers can be configured with user-managed certificates (stored as AKS secrets) [1] or Let's Encrypt (via a Kubernetes Issuer resource) [2].

Kubernetes has a secrets system which manages sensitive application information like certificates and keys and can provide them securely to containers [3].
This is managed by AKS.

Many Azure services support configuration of customer-managed keys; see the BYOK section below.

1.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/aks/ingress-own-tls
2.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/aks/ingress-tls
3.  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/

### Encryption Key Management

Like other providers, Azure's encryption services are based on
key-encryption-keys, that encrypt keys which in turn are used to
encrypt data, rather than directly encrypting data.

Azure products in general support two encryption models [1]:

*   Service-managed keys: Provides a combination of control and convenience with low overhead.
*   Customer-managed keys: Gives you control over the keys, including Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) support, or allows you to generate new ones.

For service-customer managed keys, the rotation period is explicitly
unspecified (and not guaranteed to be consistent) [5]. If there are
specific key rotation requirements, customer-managed keys are
therefore recommended.

Customer-managed keys are managed via the Azure Key Vault service. If
customer managed keys are used, use the following AZ CLI command to
configure key rotation [4]:

```bash
az keyvault storage add \
    --vault-name <YourKeyVaultName> \
    -n <YourStorageAccountName> \
    --active-key-name key1 \
    --auto-regenerate-key \
    --regeneration-period P90D \
    --resource-id "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<StorageAccountResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<YourStorageAccountName>"
```

The AKS OS disk can also be encrypted with a customer-managed key via
an Azure DiskEncryptionSet [3].

HYOK (Hold Your Own Key - managing keys outside of Azure
infrastructure) is only available in the Azure Information Protection
service, which is irrelevant to Kubernetes [2].

## Network Security

### IP Firewall Rules

Security of internal network connections within the Kubernetes architecture is ensured by the Azure service.

Application-layer filtering can be performed by ingress controller and load balancer software.

For transport layer security, the Azure Firewall service can be configured to protect AKS.

To control traffic between pods, network policies can be used - or for
more complex configurations, a service mesh. Azure offers no special
infrastructure for this, but an implementation of kubernetes
network-policies as well as the Istio, Linkerd and Consul meshes are
supported.

2.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-network-policies
3.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/servicemesh-about

## Network Isolation

To ensure that the API server can only be accessed from within a
private network, Azure supports private clusters[1].

These are created like regular clusters, except that they are set up
with `--enable-private-cluster`.

Access to the cluster will be restricted to services within the same
virtual network. To connect to this cluster, Azure gives three
options:

1. A VM created in the same virtual network.
2. A VM in a separate virtual network, that is connected through virtual network peering.
3. A VPN connection that leads to on-premises access.

The first option is the simplest, as other configurations require
complex networking.

## Underlying OS

### Use of Latest Version

Azure fully manages the host OS for the nodes and the rest of the core Kubernetes system.

Linux nodes run an optimized Ubuntu distribution using the Moby container runtime.
Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server 2019 release and also use the Moby container runtime.
When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.

Clusters are deployed on host virtual machines, which in turn are
based on Ubuntu 16.04 (the LTS release at the time of writing). This
OS is hardened by Azure, although it is explicitly not
CIS-compliant. For details, see source [2].

The Azure platform automatically applies OS security patches to Linux nodes on a nightly basis.
If a Linux OS security update requires a host reboot, that reboot is not automatically performed.
You can manually reboot the Linux nodes, or a common approach is to use Kured, an open-source reboot daemon for Kubernetes.
Kured runs as a DaemonSet and monitors each node for the presence of a file indicating that a reboot is required.

For Windows Server nodes, Windows Update does not automatically run and apply the latest updates.
On a regular schedule around the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process, you should perform an upgrade on the Windows Server node pool(s) in your AKS cluster.
This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, then removes the older nodes.

To upgrade the Kubernetes software, a similar "cordon and drain" system is used.
New, upgraded nodes are added silently added to the cluster, while old existing nodes are gracefully shut down, recreating pods and resources on the new nodes.
This happens without any downtime or intervention from the customer.
